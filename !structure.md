# General Process Work

The concept was to create a "Michelin Man-Style Presentation", where completely arbitrary, seemingly insignificant aspects of society are linked to a larger conspiracy formulating beneath our plebian lives. Drawing *heavy* inspiration from a presentation I found through an Instagram post sometime in June of 2021, I regurgitated a couple presentations to use as birthday gifts for my friends. 

How did I accomplish this gargantuan task? Well, do you know what it feels like to have both everything and nothing to work with at the same time? It is only through suffering that you can truly transcend human limitations and actualize a masterpiece.

Breaking down the reference source:  
[How The Michelin Man Is Connected to Bill Gates Divorce And How He’s Going To Destroy The Economy](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1K_7syaLvfoEXHUsoy6DWTafLiFqeNaMDsUsW39WZJRo/edit#slide=id.p)    

## Presentation Components

The presentation has 6 major components:  
1. Clear, concise title slide
2. An origin story of sorts/general context/background
3. Facts/numbers/statistics
4. A synthesis of the information
5. Questioning the significance of the information
6. End card foretelling the doom of the world/something else

## Finding substance 

- Look through chat history to potentially establish patterns or just to be reminded of certain events/conversations
- ~~if you're looking through insta you're cordially screwed even google hangouts indexes your messages have fun high speed scrolling or something~~
- I mean if you're good enough friends with whoever you'll probably remember stuff about them right

## Creating the conspiracy 

- all you gotta do
- is connect with your innermost English bs-ing self
- and let your mind overanalyze everything

In the original Michelin Man presentation, Skeen used a copious amount of arbitrary numbers to haphazardly structure bridges between concepts. I am not cultured enough to employ this strategy, but ***numbers are everywhere***. Searching for events that happened in the year that your presentation-receiver was born might also be helpful.

## Credits 

The Michelin Man-style presentations displayed were all inspired and probably created too similarly to the contents of Lucius Skeen's presentation, "**How The Michelin Man Is Connected to Bill Gates Divorce And How He’s Going To Destroy The Economy**". I have no idea which format would be appropriate to use here so I'll do them all. I'm also rather certain that "Lucius Skeen" is a pseudonym which makes the citations funnier.
