# the greatest birthday present of all time - 07/31

## Process Work 

In finding substance for this presentation, I mainly looked through discord dms. Searching for arbitary terms (in this case, "canada" and "my little pony") proved useful as it allowed me to establish patterns. This was essential in order to have the presentation come even remotely close to deceptively cohesive. I also regrettably looked through interactions on the titular platform but it was in the name of science so it's fine. 

A file sent to me (covered within the presentation) was also used.

I notably also had to walk in a forest with a friend and talk about what information I was working with before I could fully conceptualize the presentation in all its' glory.
