# the greatest birthday present of all time - 07/31

## Process Work

The concept was to create a "Michelin Man-Style Presentation", where completely arbitrary, seemingly insignificant aspects of society are linked to a larger conspiracy formulating beneath our plebian lives. Drawing *heavy* inspiration from a presentation I found through an Instagram post sometime in June of 2021, I regurgitated a presentation surrounding one of my friends as a birthday gift.

How did I accomplish this gargantuan task? Well, do you know what it feels like to have both everything and nothing to work with at the same time? It is only through suffering that you can truly transcend human limitations and actualize a masterpiece. 

To begin, one must break down the reference/source that was acquired:
https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1K_7syaLvfoEXHUsoy6DWTafLiFqeNaMDsUsW39WZJRo/edit#slide=id.p  

The presentation has 6 major components:  
1. Clear, concise title slide
2. An origin story of sorts/general context/background
3. Facts/numbers/statistics
4. A synthesis of the information
5. Questioning the significance of the information
6. End card foretelling the doom of the world/something else

In finding substance for the conspiracy, I mainly looked through discord dms. Searching for arbitary terms (in this case, "canada" and "my little pony") proved useful as it allowed me to establish patterns. This was essential in order to have the presentation come even remotely close to deceptively cohesive. 

To create the conspiracy, I would suggest that with your innermost English bs-ing self, allowing yourself to overanalyze any patterns or specific jokes that were found with utmost ease. In the original Michelin Man presentation, Skeen used a copious amount of arbitrary numbers to haphazardly structure bridges between concepts. I am not cultured enough to employ this strategy, but ***numbers are everywhere***.

## Credits 

This presentation was inspired and probably created too similarly to the contents of Lucius Skeen's presentation, "**How The Michelin Man Is Connected to Bill Gates Divorce And How He’s Going To Destroy The Economy**". I have no idea which format would be appropriate to use here so I'll do them all. I'm also rather certain that "Lucius Skeen" is a pseudonym which makes the citations funnier.
