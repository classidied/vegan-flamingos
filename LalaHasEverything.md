# the greatest birthday present of all time - 08/04

## Process Work 

I actually had a lot to work with with this presentation, as I had multiple group chats on multiple platforms with the subject of this presentation. Unfortunately my colossally-sized brain only remembered this fact after I had finished the presentation at an ungodly hour. 
Searching for patterns proved to be rather difficult, the only term that brought up a reasonable amount of content was "dog". I checked the pinned messages instead, which proved to be highly fruitful.

Never have I stayed up so late to make a slideshow (something like 1:40 AM was when I went to sleep). I don't even try this hard in school. 

I used a timed email to send the final product at 5:18AM, as she requested to call me at "4:78AM" at some point.

## The finished product
